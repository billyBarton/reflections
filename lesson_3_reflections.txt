When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

When working on a project with many people or when the intention is to share the code.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling manually allows me to to decide when I want to see the latest code.  For example, when a piece of code is ready for review or my input.
If it pulls automatically, I might get a version that is not ready for review.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

A branch occurs on an existing repository.  A branch should be used when developing code for a new concept.
A clone is a replica of a repository from local to local or local to remote.  A clone is an easy way to copy an entire repository.
A fork is a replica of a repository within GitHub and links the "cloned" repository to the original one.  A fork ensures that the original repository is linked 
and therefore credits the originator, it simultaneously clones the repository within GitHub.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
