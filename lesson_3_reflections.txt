When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

When working on a project with many people or when the intention is to share the code.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling manually allows me to to decide when I want to see the latest code.  For example, when a piece of code is ready for review or my input.
If it pulls automatically, I might get a version that is not ready for review.
